nixnote21 (2.1.0-beta3) unstable; urgency=low
  * Added few sort options (menu View)
  * Fixed to-do enml cleanup
  * Improved logging in "Import folders"
  * Quick fix/workaround for import of unfinished file in "Import folders" - files
    with ".tmp" in file name are ignored; thus file can be copied as ".tmp", then
    renamed
  * Changed internal name of nixnote binary to nixnote21; this fixes some problem with not
    displayed icons
  * Removed logic which should activate "autostart" (as it currently doesn't work with
    AppImage packaging; this can be done manually; see wiki)
  * Optimized "show" main window logic
  * "Simplify formatting" has now kbd shortcut (Ctrl-Space)
  * Fixed potential log file access conflict if 2 instances were running
  * Temporarily removed the "Count: ...." message, as it could cover recent error message
  * Removed --syncAndExit option, as there is already another way to do it command line
    parameter "sync"
  * Adjusted menu Help/Data and log location info to display active data/config paths
  * Fixed bug in command line argument handling which prevented command line "commands"
    e.g. "nixnote2 signalGui --shutdown" && "nixnote2 signalGui --show"
  * Debian packaging

nixnote21 (2.1.0-beta1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Various minor improvements and stabilisation
  * Fixed bug with media attachments
  * Improved HTML Simplify
  * Removed both webcam and screenshoot functionality (there are better tools for bot actions)
  * Show/Hide is now simplified to "Show" as previously it could lead to inconsistent behaviour
  * Sys Tray menu functionality cleanup
  * New feature search and index without [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic). This is highly
    useful for some eastern european languages. As this requires reindexing whole database, activation currently
    needs to be done manually (I'll write later some Howto)
  * Remove "auto hide toolbar option", as it was not working correctly
  * PDF export improvements
    * fixed: PDF export file picker stays in background after first PDF export.. then stays hidden=>confusing
    * OK dialog is useless
    * fixed: Filedialog should add pdf extension
  * Insert Date/Time now respect locale settings; added shortcut for Insert Date and Insert Time
    few more european date formats added
  * Adjusted middle mouse click behaviour (middle click now opens in new window)

nixnote21 (2.1.0-alfa10) unstable; urgency=low
  * Simplified content of the Help menu. Removed unrelevant items. "Message Log Info" now shows
    log file location & instructions.
  * Further stabilisation of html cleanup.
  * Duplicate note will now mark note as "- copy".
  * Added "Simplify html" to clean html garbage e.g. after paste from some web page.
    So far only very experimental version. Discards images. Will be improved later.
 -- Robert Spiegel <nightingale7@gmail.com>  Fri, 13 Jul 2018 12:00:00 -0400

nixnote21 (2.1.0-alfa8) unstable; urgency=low
  * Added **docker build**. Creating binaries ouf of source is now very straightforward.
  * Improved reporting and logging of errors (mainly for sync errors). The messages may be now
    more technical (can be improved later), but should at least display always and more
    details are in log.
 -- Robert Spiegel <nightingale7@gmail.com>  Fri, 06 Jul 2018 12:00:00 -0400

nixnote21 (2.1.0-alfa7) unstable; urgency=low
  * **Redesigned html cleanup** to prevent sync errors. Now newest html tidy libray is used (currently v.5.6).
    Before system level tidy executable was used, which could be like 9 years old.
    Pasting ~any html content into note should work now. Although sometimes images are not recognised.
    Images need to be attached manually (e.g. by drag & drop.)
  * Improved exception handling and logging. Removed log level setting in gui. Log level may now be set
    from command line using e.g. --logLevel=1 for debug level.
  * Changed some setting defaults - e.g. which columns are initially shown (default "title" only).
    Settings can be changed in preferences and are preserved on next run (same as before).
 -- Robert Spiegel <nightingale7@gmail.com>  Fri, 06 Jul 2018 12:00:00 -0400

nixnote21 (2.1.0-alfa6) unstable; urgency=low
  * [AppImage packaging](https://appimage.org/) using [linuxdeployqt](https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt).
    This should allow easy deployment "anywhere" no worry about missing dependencies
    and later use newest libraries.
  * Focus on search box after "all notes"
  * **Title column in note table view now display compound information** - Title + sync needed + relevance hint.
    (Sync is signalized by triangle at begin, if the note is found "more relevant" in search its displaed
    bold). May be later made configurable.
    Main aim is to be able to hide all other columns. Sorting is relevance+date update - so you may
    just display title column & hide all others. See: [compound title preview](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/62lnikzyf4r0sa2/AADMk-EHBwvBt7G5bOga9tyia?dl=0&preview=RS-6-compound-title.png)
  * Removed function of opening notes in new tabs - doesn't work stable and is only confusing. Could be
    re-added back later (commit id 6149a745d014f55352b2e6cad8ff4637414861b7).
  * Improved logging in case there is problem with resources (and note is set to read only in nixnote).

nixnote21 (2.1.0-alfa5) unstable; urgency=low
  * Minor improvement in font color/background color (highlight selection).
    Tooltip now shows how to use. Keyboard shortcuts possible (default Ctrl-d, Ctrl-Shift-H). Context
    menu option added. Color buttons will preserve state across program restart.
  * Tooltips with kbd shortcut info for all editor and main toolbar icons added.
  * Few more default kbd shortcuts added.
  * Remove hardcoded build in kbd shortcuts (now all comes from shortcuts.ini)
  * Changed theme handling - now all themes come from ini file (incl. of the Default theme). This is
    similar to shortcuts.txt.
  * Clear search text, after click on "All notes".
  * Restructured main toolbar.
  * Renamed theme.ini to themes.ini because of structure changes prevent loading of legacy user themes
    (they will need minor fixes to work with new version). To make things easier, now all CSS is inline.
    Loading from file my be reintroduced later.
