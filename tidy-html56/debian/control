Description: HTML/XML syntax checker and reformatter

 standards. Tidy is a product of the World Wide Web Consortium and the HTML
 Tidy Advocacy Community Group.

 This is simplified packaging, where all files are installed in /opt/tidy56 and there is only one
 package "tidy-html56". This contains binary and libraries (both runtime and development).
 The idea is, that the package can be easily installed on all supported Ubuntu version
 without conflict with possibly present system default tidy.
