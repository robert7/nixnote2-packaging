 This is simplified packaging, where all files are installed in /usr/lib/nixnote2 and there is only one
 package "nixnote2-tidy". This contains binary and libraries (both runtime and development).
 The idea is, that the package can be easily installed on all supported Ubuntu version
 without conflict with possibly present system default tidy.
